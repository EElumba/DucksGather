Description: What does it mean to give consent when social, economic, and institutional pressures make refusal difficult? This talk examines sexual violence in contemporary Japan to challenge liberal ideals of autonomy, choice, and legal equality. Drawing on Involuntary Consent: The Illusion of Choice in Japan’s Adult Video Industry (Stanford, 2023) and new NHK survey data, Takeyama shows how “involuntary consent” emerges through structural inequalities, workplace hierarchies, and gendered expectations like emotional labor. Linking commercial sex work to everyday experiences, she calls for rethinking how law, culture, and power define sexual harm—and for imagining consent that accounts for relational and structural constraints.

Presented by: Akiko Takeyama, PhD, Professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Director of the Center for East Asian Studies, University of Kansas.

Hosted by: Haruka Nagao, PhD, Assistant Professor, Deparmtent of Global Studies, University of Oregon.

Event sponsors: Global Studies Institute, Center for Asian and Pacific Studies.

Description: What does it mean to give consent when social, economic, and institutional pressures make refusal difficult? This talk examines sexual violence in contemporary Japan to challenge liberal ideals of autonomy, choice, and legal equality. Drawing on Involuntary Consent: The Illusion of Choice in Japan’s Adult Video Industry (Stanford, 2023) and new NHK survey data, Takeyama shows how “involuntary consent” emerges through structural inequalities, workplace hierarchies, and gendered expectations like emotional labor. Linking commercial sex work to everyday experiences, she calls for rethinking how law, culture, and power define sexual harm—and for imagining consent that accounts for relational and structural constraints.

Presented by: Akiko Takeyama, PhD, Professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Director of the Center for East Asian Studies, University of Kansas.

Hosted by: Haruka Nagao, PhD, Assistant Professor, Deparmtent of Global Studies, University of Oregon.

Description: ON SALE AT THE UO TICKET OFFICE IN THE EMU

Many bands chase fame through a triangulation of aspirational branding, music production software, and social media prowess. But like the countless troubadours and punk rockers who’ve inspired them, the indie rock group Glitterfox values authenticity over algorithm. Their ascent has been remarkably uncomplicated: Get in the van, play unforgettable shows in town after town, make a bunch of friends. As Solange Igoa (they/ them), the band’s effervescent frontperson, jokes, “We have always been driven by this kind of blind faith and delusional confidence.”

This has culminated in Glitterfox’s first full-length, decoder (out August 22, Jealous Butcher Records), a jubilant explosion of tracks that synthesizes the two songwriters’ garage rock, new wave, southern Americana and dance music influences into a sound that is singularly, inimitably Glitterfox.

Description: James Lavadour: Land of Origin presents the most comprehensive survey to date of works by painter and printmaker James Lavadour (Walla Walla). Spanning five decades of work, this national retrospective celebrates Lavadour’s deep connection to the eastern Oregon landscape, particularly the Umatilla Indian Reservation and surrounding Blue Mountains region where the artist has spent most of his life, and recognizes his esteemed place in contemporary American painting. The exhibition includes nearly thirty of Lavadour’s magnificent signature grid paintings, works on individual panels, and prints, most of which have never been exhibited together. It will draw on significant loans from the artist, major museum collections, and private lenders. Recognizing one of Oregon and the nation’s most original and powerful artists, James Lavadour: Land of Origin will also be accompanied by a full catalogue.

Description: Deep Listening: Classic Albums from Our Collection

Join UO Libraries weekly in the comfortable Douglass Room lounge for an immersive journey through landmark recordings from Knight Library's extensive audio collection. Each session focuses on a single classic album, providing historical context, artistic background, and guided listening that reveals the craftsmanship behind these influential works. From jazz masterpieces and classical recordings to groundbreaking rock albums and world music treasures, we'll explore how these recordings shaped musical history and continue to influence artists today. Each album will be introduced with insights into the recording process, cultural impact, and musical innovations before we settle in for focused, uninterrupted listening.

This workshop offers a rare opportunity to experience music as it was intended - as a complete artistic statement rather than isolated tracks. Participants will develop deeper appreciation for album construction, production techniques, and the art of active listening while discovering gems from our collection they might never have encountered otherwise. Whether you're a casual music fan looking to expand your horizons or a serious listener seeking new perspectives on familiar works, you'll leave each session with enhanced understanding of how great albums achieve their lasting power. The relaxed lounge setting encourages reflection and discussion, making this both an educational and meditative experience perfect for busy students, faculty, and community members seeking a weekly respite through transformative music.

Description: University of Oregon 2025-26 Visiting Artist Lecture Series
Presented by the Department of Art and Center for Art Research

Fred H. C. Liang’s recent work combines jianzhi (traditional Chinese paper cutting) with porcelain to explore cultural exchange between East and West. His installations investigate how ideas and people are disseminated, appropriated, and transformed through global encounters. Liang excavates buried histories to uncover hidden narratives that continue to shape identity and aesthetics. He invites viewers down a rabbit hole of historical and contemporary events, where unexpected connections emerge and alternate realities unfold. Rooted in materials often associated with craft and domesticity, Liang’s immersive, three-dimensional environments made from pliable paper and ceramic reimagine familiar forms. Through this process, he bridges memory and material, creating space for reflection on how rituals, traditions, and iconography are inherited and reshaped across time and culture. His work prompts a visual dialogue on the fragility and impermanence of personal and collective histories, ultimately deconstructing and re-contextualizing cultural forms to illuminate the invisible structures that govern our lives.

Fred H. C. Liang is a Boston-based artist and professor at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. He holds a BFA from the University of Manitoba and an MFA from Yale University. Liang’s work, which explores cultural exchange through printmaking, paper cutting, and ceramics, has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including at the ICA Boston, Inside Out Museum (Beijing), Currier Museum of Art, and Milwaukee Art Museum. His work is held in public and private collections such as Fidelity, the Gund Collection, the Addison Museum of American Art, and the Rose Art Museum. Liang has been recognized with grants from the Massachusetts Cultural Council, the Joan Mitchell Foundation (2020), and the Boston Foundation’s Brother Thomas Fellowship (2021). He has completed residencies at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo (Santiago, Chile) and the Swatch Art Peace Hotel (Shanghai). His work has been featured in HuffPost, WBUR Open Studio, and The Boston Globe.

This lecture is made possible by the Gilkey Foundation Fund.

Over five decades, Rauschenberg has compiled a truly distinctive archive of photographs encompassing a wide array of themes, styles, uses of the medium, and range of subjects and content. This important resource represents a diverse mix of international and nationally emerging and established photographers.

Rauschenberg typically acquires photographs directly from the artists or from non-profit community-based arts organizations exhibiting or representing their works. Rauschenberg has also traveled extensively and participated for decades as a highly regarded reviewer of photography portfolios at international gatherings of specialists who utilize and support opportunities for working creative photographers.

In Gathering, one will find a wealth of individual points of view that, when engaged, may broaden each of our own visions: whether those considered perspectives are personal, familiar, social, cultural, political, or spiritual.

Description: Presented By Michael Aguilera and Brandon Folse (Sociology)

Join us for a compelling research talk with Michael Aguilera and Brandon Folse as they uncover the surprising realities behind US deportation policy. Using data from the Mexican Migration Project, their study reveals how deportation—often seen as a deterrent—can actually deepen migrants’ ties to the United States. Deported individuals frequently remigrate and ultimately spend more total time in the US than those who were never deported.

By framing deportation as a form of legal violence, Aguilera and Folse shed light on how migrants adapt, resist, and rebuild in the face of systemic barriers—offering new perspectives on migration, belonging, and resilience.

Co-sponsored by the Center for Latino/a and Latin American Studies (CLLAS) and the Department of Sociology at the University of Oregon.

Description: This seminar surveys China’s cultural history through brief excerpts of significant literature well known to Chinese, and key to understanding the context of current Chinese thought. The student will acquire a knowledge of and appreciation for major literature from critical periods of Chinese history that shape or reflect the thinking of contemporary educated Chinese. The classical period set patterns of hierarchy, as well as the role of personal meditation, attachment to place and social networks. Revolutionary period work reflected the struggles of encounters with the West and national identity adjustments, from self-mocking pain at foreign repression to assertive nationalism. The major work of Mao (a classically trained librarian) continues the transitional struggle in both a practical and more strategically violent way, echoing some of the hubris of a legendary semi-hero. The final globally distinguished selections combine major elements of this literary heritage playing out in the present.

This important resource represents a diverse mix of international and nationally emerging and established photographers.

Rauschenberg has also traveled extensively and participated for decades as a highly regarded reviewer of photography portfolios at international gatherings of specialists who utilize and support opportunities for working creative photographers.

In Gathering, one will find a wealth of individual points of view that, when engaged, may broaden each of our own visions: whether those considered perspectives are personal, familiar, social, cultural, political, or spiritual.
